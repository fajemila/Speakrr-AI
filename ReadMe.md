# Voice Search and Text Classification Repository

## Overview
This repository contains code and models for performing voice similarity search, text classification of personal vs non-personal questions, and speech recognition inference. It provides a set of tools and utilities to process audio and text data, perform similarity search, and classify questions based on their personal or non-personal nature.

## Features
- Voice similarity search: Allows users to search for similar voice patterns in a given audio dataset.
- Text classification: Classifies questions as personal or non-personal based on their textual content.
- Speech recognition inference: Utilizes pre-trained models to transcribe audio recordings into text.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-search-classification.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
